# What is this?

This is FIRST real serious project,
this project will contain the studying process

- What kind of studying?
  Welp, im actually into learning new languages...
  Because I want to speak to another people
  Actually, i dont like to study them but the oportunity
  that i can speak to people which i cant talk before because of language

- Will i keep going into that stuff daily, monthly?
  Idk

- Why am I doing this?
  Idk neither. I`ll just make like... Lessons? I will wrote everything
that i`ve learned for that lesson. Actually it will be kinda site for studying yk

- What about other projects?
  Um, im working at JS and NODE.JS projects a little bit and I cant do it daily
  Because of my apathetic "mood". Its hard to do something, i rly love programming but
  im getting bored of everything. This is my last chanse to organise myself & study at school
  (Im at pre-graduate class so yeah...)

- Do you want to other ppl know about you?
  Nah, idc.. But support is great thing, yk..
  If you interested at theese type of "blogs" you can follow me at my git-hub & tiktok (lol)
